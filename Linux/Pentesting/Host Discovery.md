## netdiscover

Netdiscover is an open-source network reconnaissance tool that is used for scanning and identifying live hosts on a network. This command is particularly useful for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals who need to understand which devices are currently active on their networks. It operates by sending ARP requests to a specified range of IP addresses or on a particular network interface, and it listens for ARP replies to identify live hosts.

Syntax:
```bash
netdiscover [options] ip address {interface}
```

Options:

	-r (range) :scans a given range instead of auto scan.

	-c (count) :number of times to send each arp request.

	-f  :enables fast mode scan.

	-i (device) :the network interface to sniff and inject packets.


The following input will scan the IP range on the network interface for active hosts


```shell
netdiscover -r 172.16.6.0/23 -i eth0
```
 

Example Output:

```sql
Currently scanning: 172.16.6.0/23   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts
192.168.6.1     00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E  (Unknown Vendor)
192.168.6.5     00:1A:2B:3C:4D:6F  (Dell Inc)
192.168.7.10    00:1A:2B:AA:BB:CC  (HP)
```


## arp-scan

‘Arp-scan’ is a command-line tool used to identify active devices on a network. It operates by sending Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests to specified IP addresses or ranges, allowing users to discover devices that are online and connected to the network. This makes it especially useful for system administrators or network engineers who need to troubleshoot network issues, ensure network security, or perform inventory assessments.


Syntax:
```bash
arp-scan [options] {ip address w/ subnet}
```

Options:

	-l or --localnet is used to generate addresses from interface configuration.

	-I or --interface specifies a network interface. If this option is not specified, arp-scan will search the system interface list for the lowest numbered, configured up interface.

The following input will scan the current local network while specifying the NIC
```shell
arp-scan -l -I eth0
```

Example Output:

```csharp
Interface: eth0, datalink type: EN10MB (Ethernet)
Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools-resources/security-tools/arp-scan/)
192.168.1.1     00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e       Router Inc.
192.168.1.2     11:22:33:44:55:66       Laptop-Device
192.168.1.10    00:25:96:ff:fe:12:34    Printer Co.
3 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
Ending arp-scan 1.9.7: 256 hosts scanned in 2.004 seconds (127.77 hosts/sec). 3 responded
```

*****Note you can also scan the network with a custom Bitmask, or custom range:
```shell
arp-scan 192.168.1.1/24

arp-scan 172.16.10.0-172.16.10.31
```



## nmap

Nmap, short for “Network Mapper,” is a powerful open-source tool designed for network exploration, security auditing, and port scanning. It is extensively used by network administrators and security professionals to discover network assets, verify security measures, and even test firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Nmap offers numerous capabilities such as scanning large networks, detecting operating system versions, and finding open ports. It also provides flexibility in terms of verbosity, timing, and output options, among others. Its real strength lies in its ability to provide a comprehensive overview of network configurations and vulnerabilities, enabling users to ensure a more secure network environment.


#### Syntax:
```bash
nmap {Scan Type} [Options] {target specification}
```

#### Scan Types:

	-sS :TCP SYN scan (ran by default) allows you to determine the state of the port without a full connection.

	-sT :TCP connect scan is used by default if the SYN scan is not an option. Connects to the target using a system call and uses an API to obtain status information

	-sU :UDP scan used to determine what state the UDP port is in. 

	-sn :This flag performs host discovery but does not scan any ports. Its used to see if a host is online without taking too much time.
	
	-Pn :This flag is used when you want to disable ping and only scan for open ports.

	-PR :performs ARP discoveries on local networks.

	-n :This flag specifies that it must not try to resolve DNS entries.

	 -sV :This flag determines what version of services are running on the target host.
	
	-O: This flag is used for OS detection.

	-A: Known as “Aggressive Detection” it runs several flags at once.

#### Options:

	-p- :This flag instructs nmap to scan all ports (only the top 1000 ports are scanned by default)

	-T :this flag sets the timing (speed) at which nmap scans. -T0 being the slowest and -T5 being the fastest.
	
	 -oN: This flag saves to normal output using a given file name.

	-oX: This flag outputs data to an XML format.

	-oG: This flag saves data into a greppable format

	-oA: This command flag does all three data output types at once.

	-iL :This flag allows nmap to read from a text file containing IP addresses

	-sC :This flag runs the default script scan. However, there are many more script options located in /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory.


The following is an example of scanning a remote host disabling the ping feature:
```shell
nmap -Pn 192.168.5.7 
```

To scan all open ports on the remote host ensure to use to -p- option:
```shell
nmap -Pn 192.168.5.7 -p-
```

Example Output:

```plaintext
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-10-10 12:30 UTC
Nmap scan report for example.com (192.168.5.7)

```

The following is an example of scanning a range of remote hosts while disabling DNS resolve feature and adding 2 levels of verbosity :
```shell
nmap -n -vv 192.168.5.7-27 
			-OR-
nmap -n -vv 192.168.5.7,8,9,10
```
