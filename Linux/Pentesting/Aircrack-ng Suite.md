### airmon-ng

Utility to place wireless interface into adapter mode

SYNTAX:

```bash
sudo airmon-ng [OPTION] [INTERFACE] [CHANNEL]
```

OPTIONS:

    -check
        Print services which may interfere with airmon-ng
    -check kill 
        Kill services which may interfere with airmon-ng
    -start
        Create a monitor mode virtual interface of specificed adapter 
	-stop
        Disable a monitor mode virtual interface of specificed adapter in monitor mode

EXAMPLES:

```bash
# Print and kill services which may interefere with airmon-ng  
sudo airmon-ng check kill

#  Place wlan1 into monitor mode 
sudo airmon-ng start wlan1

#  Revert wlan1mon from monitor mode into managed mode
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan1mon

# Place wlan1 into monitor mode on channel 6 
sudo airmon-ng start wlan1 6

```

### airodump-ng

Utility to monitor and record Wi-Fi signals

SYNTAX:

```bash
sudo airodump-ng [OPTION] <MONITOR INTERFACE>
```

OPTIONS:

    --band <BAND>
        Monitor specified band (a,b,g)
    --channel <CHANNEL> (-c <CHANNEL>)
        Monitor specifed channel
    --write <OUTPUT> (-W <OUTPUT>)
	    Save captured frames to files without OUTPUT prefix 
    --bssid <BSSID>
        Capture filter which only monitors specified BSSID 
	--essid <ESSID>
        Capture filter which only monitors specified ESSID
	--manufacturer (-m)
		Prints a UI column that resolves OUI 
	--uptime
		Prints a column that resolves Beacon Timestamp 
	   

EXAMPLES:

```bash
# Sweep all bands with wlan1mon interface   
sudo airodump-ng --band ab wlan1mon

#  Monitor channel 44, only record target BSSID traffic, and write output with 'muppet' prefix with wlan1mon interface
sudo airodump-ng --channel 44 --bssid ab:cd:ef:12:34:56 -w muppet wlan1mon

```

UI NAVIGATION NOTES:

	a
		cycle active pane (AP+STA; AP+STA+ACK; STA only)
	spacebar
		pause/unpause current view
	m
		mark current selection to identify assocations
	s
		change sorting pattern (cycles through columns)
	i
		inverts sorting pattern (cycles through columns)


### airgraph-ng

Utility to create ANB-like visualization of airodump-ng output (Must be installed, and requires Internet access during first use)

SYNTAX:

```bash
# Install: 
sudo apt install airgraph-ng

# Usage:
sudo airgraph-ng -i <INPUT CSV> -o <OUTPUT PNG> -g <FORMAT>
```

OPTIONS:

    -i <INPUT CSV>
        Input CSV file previously produced with airodump-ng
    -o <OUTPUT PNG>
        Created output graphic with desired name  
    -g CAPR
        Creates a graph of Client to Access Point Relationships 
	-g CPG
        Creates a Client Probe Graph

EXAMPLES:

```bash
# Create a graphic of all with all AP/STA correlations from muppet.csv 
sudo airgraph-ng -i muppet.csv -out muppet_networks -g CAPR

# Create a graphic of all probing STA and probed SSIDs from muppet.csv 
sudo airgraph-ng -i muppet.csv -out muppet_probes -g CPG

```

## Aireplay-ng

### aireplay-ng (Fakeauth)

Utility to inject wireless packets -- Fake authentication for WEP networks.  

SYNTAX:

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng --fakeauth <INTERVAL> [OPTIONS] <INTERFACE>
```

 OPTIONS

    --fakeauth <INTERVAL> (-1 <INTERVAL>)
	    Fake authentication with the AP
    -a <BSSID> 
        AP MAC address
    -h <STA MAC>
        Host STA MAC address

EXAMPLES
```bash
# Send a fake authentication to BSSID aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 as STA 66:55:44:33:22:11 on interface wlan1mon every five seconds
sudo aireplay-ng -1 5 -a aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 -h 66:55:44:33:22:11 wlan1mon
```
    

### aireplay-ng (ARP Replay)

Utility to inject wireless packets -- re-inject an ARP frame repeatedly to create fresh WEP IVs.  

SYNTAX:

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng --arpreplay [OPTIONS] <INTERFACE>
```

 OPTIONS

    --arpreplay  (-3)
	    Fake authentication with the AP
    -b <BSSID> 
        AP MAC address
    -h <STA MAC>
        Client STA MAC address

EXAMPLES
```bash
# Repeatedly replay any discovered ARP frame on BSSID aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 as STA 66:55:44:33:22:11 on interface wlan1mon to generate fresh WEP IVs.
sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 -h 66:55:44:33:22:11 wlan1mon

```
    
### aireplay-ng (Deauth)

Utility to inject wireless packets -- Deauthenticate a single or all STA from network.  

SYNTAX:

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth <COUNT> [OPTIONS] <INTERFACE>
```

 OPTIONS

    --deauth <COUNT> (-0 <COUNT>)
	    Fake authentication with the AP
    -a <BSSID> 
        AP MAC address
    -c <STA MAC>
        Client STA MAC address

EXAMPLES
```bash
# Send a single Deauthentication frame to STA 66:55:44:33:22:11 on BSSID aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 on interface wlan1mon
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 -c 66:55:44:33:22:11 wlan1mon

# Send a single Deauthentication to all STA on BSSID aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 on interface wlan1mon
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 wlan1mon


# Send infinite  Deauthentication frames to STA 66:55:44:33:22:11 on BSSID aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 on interface wlan1mon
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 -c 66:55:44:33:22:11 wlan1mon
